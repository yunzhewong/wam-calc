# WAM-Calculator (28/06/2021)

# Why did I start this project
This project was built to test out my abilities with React. The goal was to create a website that makes it easy for students to check their WAM 
by simply copy pasting their results into a text box. This is significantly easier than having to manually input every result into an external table,
even though the appearance would not be as attractive.

# Project Specifics
This project is written in React, with small amounts of CSS to style the components. Using Github Pages, I am able to host this online.

# What would I do to improve it?
As I am currently pursuing different projects, I am not actively trying to improve this project. However, if I had to improve a particular portion, it would be the
formatting of the project. At the moment, it does not look visually appealing and could use some final touches in that regard.
